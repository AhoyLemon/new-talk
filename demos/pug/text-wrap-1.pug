          h2 The Default Wrapping is text-wrap: wrap
          p
            | This section specifically shows the standard wrapping. The browser
            | breaks lines to fit, without any visual refinement or advanced
            | optimization, often leaving single words stranded on the final line
            | or creating maybe visually uneven text blocks.
          p
            | Observe how words are split purely at the container's edge entirely.
            | This default method doesn't consider typographical niceties like
            | avoiding isolated words orphaned on their own line.

        section.container.pretty-wrap-container
          h2 Understanding text-wrap: pretty for Readability
          p
            | Applying #[strong text-wrap: pretty] refines line breaking for
            | visual harmony. It actively strives to eliminate single words
            | orphaned at a paragraph's end, ensuring a cleaner visual flow
            | and greatly improving readability for longer content like paragraphs.
          p
            | With #[strong pretty], the browser smartly optimizes text flow,
            | significantly reducing instances of awkward gaps or isolated
            | short lines. This subtle yet powerful enhancement truly boosts
            | the aesthetic appeal of your extended prose and stuff.

        section.container.balance-wrap-container
          h2 text-wrap: balance for Visually Appealing Headlines and also Short Phrases
          p
            | Here, we use #[strong text-wrap: balance]. This property is specifically designed
            | to create more visually balanced lines of text, especially for short blocks
            | like headlines, captions, or short paragraphs. The browser tries to make
            | lines of roughly equal length.
          p
            | Observe how the text breaks in a way that distributes words more evenly
            | across lines, preventing extreme short or long lines within a single block.
            | This often leads to a more compact and aesthetically pleasing appearance
            | for titles and concise statements.
